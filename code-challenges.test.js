// ASSESSMENT 6: JavaScript Coding Practical Questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// Pseudo coding is REQUIRED
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Add appropriate dependencies: $ yarn add jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function
// Run the file with the following command: $ yarn jest

// --------------------1) Create a function that takes in an array of objects and returns an array with a sentence about each person with their name capitalized.

// a) Create a test with an expect statement using the variable provided.

const people = [
  { name: "ford prefect", occupation: "a hitchhiker" },
  { name: "zaphod beeblebrox", occupation: "president of the galaxy" },
  { name: "arthur dent", occupation: "a radio employee" }
]
// Expected output: ["Ford Prefect is a hitchhiker.", "Zaphod Beeblebrox is president of the galaxy.", "Arthur Dent is a radio employee."]

describe("about", () => {
  it(
    "returns an array with a sentence about each person with their name capitalized",
    () => {
      expect(about(people)).toEqual([
        "Ford Prefect is a hitchhiker.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox is president of the galaxy.",
        "Arthur Dent is a radio employee."
      ]);
    });
});


// ReferenceError: about is not defined, This is a good error.... now we just have to build out the function to make this test pass.

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// Since the first character of each element of the object array needs to be capitalized.. and theNNNn...
// We need to iterate through each element and pull the first character of the name key and capitalize it... and theNNNn
// We can do this by using .map() to iterate through each element and push the name key into a new array.
// thenNn.. I need to figure out two split up the keys from their values.. and theNnn.. there is the .split()
// what we'll do is once they're split we will map through the elements in the new array, 
// access charAt(0) attached .toUpperCase and since it capitalized all the characters, we will use .slice(1)
// on each element to separate the at index 1 of the element so isolate the first capitalized character
// we then use .join() to join back the name element
// finally we string interpolation to form the sentence using the key value pairs: name and occupation
// and return the new array of sentences. 

const about = (people) => {
  let sentence = people.map((person) => {
    const namesArray = person.name.split(" ");
    const names = namesArray
      .map((element) => {
        return (element = element.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + element.slice(1));
      })
      .join(" ");
    return `${names} is ${person.occupation}.`;
  });
  return sentence;
};

// Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
// Snapshots:   0 total
// Time:        0.157 s
// Ran all test suites.
// âœ¨  Done in 0.55s.

// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in a mixed data array and returns an array of only the REMAINDERS of the numbers when divided by 3.

// a) Create a test with an expect statement using the variables provided.

const hodgepodge1 = [23, "Heyyyy!", 45, -10, 0, "Yo", false];
// Expected output: [ 2, 0, -1, 0 ]
const hodgepodge2 = [5, "Hola", 43, -34, "greetings", true];
// Expected output: [ 2, 1, -1 ]

describe("remainingNumbers", () => {
  it("takes in a mixed data array and returns an array of only the REMAINDERS of the numbers when divided by 3.", () => {
    expect(remainingNumbers(hodgepodge1)).toEqual([2, 0, -1, 0]);
    expect(remainingNumbers(hodgepodge2)).toEqual([2, 1, -1]);
  });
});

// ReferenceError: remainingNumbers is not defined, good fail, lets make a function to make this test passsssssss....

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// First thing is first.. we have to figure out how to select only the numbers of the mixed data array.
// We can use type() iterate through the array and select only the value of 'number' and return it to a new array.
// From there we will iterate through the new array along with the method to divide each number by three and return the remainders in a new array.

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.
// we need a function that takes in an array and checks for division by three
// first thing we need to do is filter out all of the non-number elements. We can use filter method
// once we have the arrays with just numbers, we can chain .map method and divide each number using mod operator
// resulting array will have division by 3 remainders as elements

const remainingNumbers = (array) =>
  array.filter((e) => typeof e === 'number').map((e) => e % 3);

// // --------------------3) Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers cubed.

// // a) Create a test with an expect statement using the variables provided.

// const cubeAndSum1 = [2, 3, 4]
// // Expected output: 99
// const cubeAndSum2 = [0, 5, 10]
// // Expected output: 1125

// // b) Create the function that makes the test pass.
